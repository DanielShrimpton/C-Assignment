# Game of Life - C Programming Assignment - Year 2

### Overview
This assignment asked me to create an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using C. The requirements were to create a shared object library and to make a dynamically linked library.

## gameoflife.c
This file is the main executable for the Game of Life. It parses all inputs including flags or universes but relies on the functions in `gol.h` and `gol.c` to work properly.
